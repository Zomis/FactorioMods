[mod-setting-description]
copy-paste-recipe-signals-ingredient-multiplier=Multiplies all ingredients with this amount (Set 0 to turn off)
copy-paste-recipe-signals-product-multiplier=Multiplies all products with this amount (Set 0 to turn off)
copy-paste-recipe-signals-include-ticks=Add the signal T for the number of ticks the recipe takes (1 second = 60 ticks)
copy-paste-recipe-signals-include-seconds=Add the signal S for the number of seconds the recipe takes
copy-paste-recipe-time-includes-modules=The signals T and S will be adjusted according to the speed of the machine (including speed modules)
copy-paste-recipe-copy-item-count-as-request-chest=Copies the number of items in the same way as in the vanilla request chest(multiplier affected), i.e. to request enough items for a recipe to keep the machine running for 30 seconds.
copy-paste-recipe-time-paste-product-arithmetic="Copy first output product to arithmetic combinator's first signal"
copy-paste-recipe-time-paste-product-decider="Copy first output product to decider combinator's first signal"
