[mod-setting-description]
copy-paste-recipe-signals-ingredient-multiplier=When copying from a machine with a recipe, multiplies all ingredients with this amount (Set 0 to turn off)
copy-paste-recipe-signals-product-multiplier=When copying from a machine with a recipe, multiplies all products with this amount (Set 0 to turn off)
copy-paste-recipe-signals-include-ticks=When copying from a machine with a recipe, add the signal T for the number of ticks the recipe takes (1 second = 60 ticks)
copy-paste-recipe-signals-include-seconds=When copying from a machine with a recipe, add the signal S for the number of seconds the recipe takes
copy-paste-recipe-time-includes-modules=When copying from a machine with a recipe, the signals T and S will be adjusted according to the speed of the machine (including speed modules)
copy-paste-recipe-copy-item-count-as-request-chest=When copying from a machine with a recipe, copies the number of items in the same way as in the vanilla request chest(multiplier affected), i.e. to request enough items for a recipe to keep the machine running for 30 seconds.
copy-paste-recipe-time-paste-product-arithmetic=Enable copy to arithmetic combinator's first signal
copy-paste-recipe-time-paste-product-decider=Enable copy to decider combinator's first signal
copy-paste-circuit-condition=Enable copy to circuit condition's first signal (if no other copying happens)

[copy-paste-action]
copy-paste-recipe-signals-popup=Set circuit condition to __1__ __2__ __3__
